# Image Fragmenter

CLI-based clone of [a project of the same name by Grace Manning](https://github.com/gracebmanning/image-fragmenter).

## What does it do?

This program creates glitchy GIFs by choosing a random rectangular chunk of the input image, and copying it to a random location. This process gets repeated a number of times, and the output of each iteration becomes a frame in the generated GIF.
